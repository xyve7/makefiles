# makefiles

## Introduction

This repository contained 2 main makefiles which I use to compile my C projects with.  
I'm not the greatest at GNU Make, however, these files work, so I'm gonna assume I did something right.

## Guide

`single/` contains the GNU Makefile(s) I use to compile a single project.  
`multi/` containes the GNU Makefile I use to compile a project which has multiple sub projects.
`multi/` relies on `single/` GNU Makefile(s) to compile the sub projects.
